# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Lex Parser: Text -> context-free phrase structure grammar representation

* .hocr -> .folia
* .txt -> .folia

## Data

* FoLiA is an XML-based annotation format, suitable for the representation of linguistically annotated language resources.

## CRF++

CRF++ is a simple, customizable, and open source implementation of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for segmenting/labeling sequential data. 
CRF++ is designed for generic purpose and will be applied to a variety of NLP tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition, Information Extraction and Text Chunking.

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for conditional probability. 
HMMs are for joint probability.
CRF models the dependency between each state and the entire input sequences.
In NLP, linear chain CRFs are popular, which implement sequential dependencies in the predictions.

Syntactic and semantic processing can be done independently. In human understanding it may be done simultaneously.
